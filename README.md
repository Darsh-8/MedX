## ‚≠ê Overview

MedX is an innovative, AI-powered platform designed to provide accessible and preliminary diagnostic insights for a range of critical medical conditions.

> The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and the complexity of medical diagnosis often lead to delays, misinterpretations, and a heavy burden on healthcare systems. Accessible and accurate early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes.

MedX offers an elegant solution by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models to assist in the early identification of potential health issues. Our platform empowers users with preliminary information, fostering proactive health management and facilitating timely medical consultations.

### Inferred Architecture
MedX is structured as a robust, full-stack application designed for scalability and maintainability. It comprises:
*   **Frontend:** A dynamic and interactive user interface built with the **Laravel** framework, featuring modern web technologies like **Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**. This layer handles user interactions, data presentation, and integrates an intelligent chatbot for guided assistance.
*   **Backend:** A powerful **Django REST API** serving as the core intelligence hub. This backend hosts and exposes a suite of advanced **Machine Learning models** specialized in various medical diagnostic predictions. It manages data processing, model inference, and secure API endpoints.

This decoupled architecture ensures that the user experience is fluid and responsive, while the diagnostic capabilities are robust, high-performing, and easily extensible.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get MedX up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

*   **Python:** Version 3.8+
*   **Node.js:** Version 18+ (includes `npm`)
*   **Composer:** PHP dependency manager
*   **PHP:** Version 8.1+
*   **Git:** Version Control System

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MedX.git
    cd MedX
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd Backend

    # Create and activate a Python virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    # venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install Python dependencies (Note: A requirements.txt is not provided in source,
    # so we infer common dependencies. You might need to adjust based on your exact setup.)
    pip install django djangorestframework numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow scikit-image pillow

    # Apply database migrations
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

    cd .. # Navigate back to the root directory
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd Frontend

    # Install PHP dependencies
    composer install

    # Install Node.js dependencies
    npm install

    # Configure environment variables
    cp .env.example .env
    # Open the .env file and set up your application's base URL (APP_URL)
    # and ensure API_BASE_URL points to your Django backend (e.g., http://localhost:8000)

    # Generate an application key
    php artisan key:generate

    # Build frontend assets for production (optional for dev server)
    npm run build

    cd .. # Navigate back to the root directory
    ```

---

## üîß Usage

Once installed, you can start the MedX backend API and frontend application.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd Backend
    source venv/bin/activate # Activate virtual environment if not already active
    python manage.py runserver
    # The Django backend API will typically be available at http://localhost:8000/
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    cd Frontend
    npm run dev
    # The Laravel frontend development server will usually be available at http://localhost:5173/ (or similar Vite port)
    # Open this URL in your web browser to access MedX.
    ```

    *   For a production setup, you would typically run `php artisan serve` or configure a web server like Nginx/Apache to serve the `public/` directory after running `npm run build`.

### Example API Request (Skin Cancer Detection)

To interact with the backend API directly (e.g., for image-based diagnostics), you can use `curl` or any API client. Here's an example for the inferred Skin Cancer prediction endpoint:

```bash
# Ensure your backend server is running (http://localhost:8000/)
# Replace 'path/to/your/image.jpg' with the actual path to a skin lesion image file.
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "image=@path/to/your/image.jpg" \
  http://localhost:8000/skinCancer/predict/
```
*Note: The exact API endpoints may vary based on your backend's `urls.py` configuration.*
